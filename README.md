# LED Lighting UPS

The LED Lighting UPS system is intended to provide backup lighting or primary lighting for a study room.
It can be used as backup for existing AC-powered lighting to provide lighting when the AC power goes down.
It can also be used as the primary lighting source for a room that has no existing AC-powered lighting.
Being a UPS, it auto-switches to its internal battery when the AC power goes down, and back to AC when
it comes back up.
